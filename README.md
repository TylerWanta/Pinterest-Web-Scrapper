## Pinterest-Web-Scrapper
Used to get images off of Pinterest

# Features
- Utilization of Selenium for logging in and controlling web page
- Utilization of Scrapy for easy web scrapping
- Demonstration knowledge of data collection skills

# Why
- I was trying to see if I could train a model to re create 'fashionable' outfits. For this, (not) surprisingly, I needed a lot of images of outfits that were deemed fashionable. Some progress was made but, unfortunatly, the notebook was lost =(

# Disclamer
- Images scrapped from Pinterest were soley used for the purpose of Data Analysis. None of the images were ever reuploaded, posted, or distributed
